Create a table with selectable cells and rows. The table should consist of 3 columns with 3 rows.
Every cell by default should have a white background color. Every cell should have the text “Cell”
inside. The table should have one special cell with the text inside “Special cell” (you can put this
special cell anywhere you want, expect first columns). The table should follow the next
functionality:

- If you click on some cell, the background color on this cell should toggle to yellow.
- If you click on a cell in the first column the row of the selected cell should toggle background
  color to blue. Note: if in this row you select some other cell with the color yellow, the color
  of this row should not be changed.
- If you click on a special cell, the background color on the whole table and cells, that were
  not selected should toggle to yellow.

## Priority of colors:

1. Yellow
2. Blue
3. Green
