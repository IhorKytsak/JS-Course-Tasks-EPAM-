Create an input field with validation. The input field should have a default black border. On the
right side of the input should be the “Send” button. On typing text in the input field, you should
validate the typed data. The data is valid when user type phone number in next format -
+380\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. If data is invalid, you should disable the button, change the input border to red,
and show a notification block above the input with the message, that data is invalid. If data is valid,
the button should be available. On the button click, you should show a notification block above the
input field with the message, that data was successfully sent.
